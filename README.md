# Twitter
This project allows user to scrape data from the API with the entered keyword and date using the Twitter API. It shows the timestamp, number of likes and retweets of the tweet. So using keywords or hashtags we can analyze the extracted data.
Also i have extracted the old tweets without the APIs which provides a solution to the limit of APIs.
